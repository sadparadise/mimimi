A Snake clone made in Pygame with very low knowledge of how to write good code.

Feel free to ignore it as it doesn't show any good inside or something alike :)

## Particularities

* There are no edges in the game, so if you exit the screen space you may end up exploring the void untill the end of time
* The arrow keys make the snake go directly to where they're pointing to. It's not a turn-left-turn-right type of snake
* You die if your head touches any of your body's parts, except the last one (this may change in a soon release

## Controls

* q - exit the game
* arrow keys - control direction

It's as basic as this. Kinda trash, don't need to tell.
